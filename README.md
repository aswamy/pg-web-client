# Developer Goals

A list of items I would like to do to make it fun for me (as the developer) :D

- Develop an web application without using a full framework like Angular, React, or Vue.js
- Use Polymer projects to build web components
- Minify assets using Webpack
- Use Babel to allow better compatibility with older browsers
- Use a diagramming library to make interesting visuals for tables and their relations
- Make a native application using Electron (or something similar)
